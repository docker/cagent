# TUI Image Attachment Implementation Summary

## Problem
The cagent application supported image attachments in CLI mode (`--tui=false`) but not in the default TUI mode.

## Solution
Implemented comprehensive attachment support for TUI mode while maintaining backward compatibility with CLI mode.

## Key Changes

### 1. New Shared Attachment Package (`pkg/attachment/`)
- `ParseAttachCommand()` - Parses `/attach <path>` commands from user input
- `CreateUserMessageWithAttachment()` - Creates messages with image attachments  
- `FileToDataURL()` - Converts image files to base64 data URLs
- Supports PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP, and SVG formats

### 2. TUI Editor Enhancement (`pkg/tui/components/editor/`)
- Modified `SendMsg` struct to include `AttachmentPath` field
- Added attachment parsing on message send (Enter key)
- Updated placeholder text to guide users: "Type your message here... (use /attach <path> to add images)"
- Added help binding for `/attach <path>` command

### 3. App Integration (`pkg/app/`)
- Added `RunWithAttachment()` method to handle both regular and attachment messages
- Added `ConfigFilename()` accessor method
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing `Run()` method

### 4. Chat Page Updates (`pkg/tui/page/chat/`)
- Updated message processing to handle attachment paths
- Integration with app's new attachment handling

### 5. CLI Refactoring (`cmd/root/`)
- Refactored to use shared attachment package
- Removed duplicate attachment parsing and processing code
- Maintained existing CLI flags and functionality

## Usage Examples

### TUI Mode (New)
```
/attach screenshot.png What do you see in this image?
Please analyze /attach diagram.svg and explain the flow
/attach photo.jpg
```

### CLI Mode (Existing, Unchanged)
```bash
./bin/cagent run agent.yaml --tui=false --attach image.png
echo "/attach image.png Analyze this" | ./bin/cagent run agent.yaml --tui=false
```

## Testing
- Added comprehensive unit tests for attachment functionality
- All existing tests pass (no regressions)
- Supports all image formats: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP, BMP, SVG
- Handles error cases gracefully (missing files, unsupported formats)

## Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when files don't exist or are invalid
- Error messages included in chat content rather than blocking conversation
- Maintains chat flow even when attachments fail

## Benefits
1. **Feature Parity**: TUI mode now supports same attachment functionality as CLI
2. **Code Reuse**: Eliminated code duplication between TUI and CLI modes  
3. **User Experience**: Intuitive `/attach` command syntax in TUI
4. **Backward Compatibility**: No changes to existing CLI workflows
5. **Robustness**: Comprehensive error handling and testing

The implementation successfully addresses the original issue while improving code organization and maintainability.
