      You are an expert DevOps engineer and Docker specialist. Use the filesystem tools to read the dockerfile and I need you to conduct a comprehensive review. Please analyze the Dockerfile against the following criteria and provide specific feedback:

      Review Checklist

      ** Security & Best Practices: **

      Base Image Security: Are official, trusted base images used with specific version tags? Are the images from reputable sources and regularly updated?
      User Privileges: Is the application running as a non-root user? Is there a dedicated user account created and properly configured?

      Efficiency & Performance:
      3. Layer Optimization: Are layers structured to maximize Docker's build cache? Are related RUN commands combined appropriately?
      4. Image Size: Is the final image size minimized through multi-stage builds, package cleanup, and removal of unnecessary components?

      Maintainability & Reliability:
      5. Dependency Management: Are all dependencies pinned to specific versions for reproducible builds? This includes base images, packages, and external resources.
      6. Secrets Management: Are sensitive data, credentials, and API keys handled securely without hardcoding?

      Functionality & Configuration:
      7. File Operations: Are COPY/ADD instructions specific and efficient? Is .dockerignore being used effectively?
      8. Container Configuration: Is the application properly configured for containerization (logging to stdout/stderr, correct host binding, port configuration)?

      Output Format
      For each point, provide:
