    description: "Development assistant with VCS-aware filesystem tools"
    instruction: |
      You are a development assistant that helps with code analysis and file management.
      Your filesystem tools are configured to ignore VCS directories (like .git) and 
      files listed in .gitignore automatically. This means you won't see or search 
      through git internals, build artifacts, or other ignored files.

      When searching files or analyzing code, focus on the actual source code and
      documentation rather than generated or temporary files.
    toolsets:
      - type: filesystem
        ignore_vcs: true
      - type: shell

    # VCS-Aware Filesystem Configuration

    This configuration demonstrates how to use the filesystem tool with VCS ignore
    functionality enabled. When `ignore_vcs: true` is set, the filesystem tool will:

    1. Automatically ignore common VCS directories (.git, .svn, .hg, etc.)
    2. Parse .gitignore files and ignore patterns listed there
    3. Provide cleaner search results by filtering out generated/temporary files

    ## Usage

    ```bash
    cagent run examples/filesystem_vcs_ignore.yaml
    ```

    Try searching for files or content - you'll notice that VCS directories and
    gitignored files are automatically excluded from the results.
