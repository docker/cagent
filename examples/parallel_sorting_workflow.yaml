agents:
  generate_array:
    model: openai/gpt-4o
    instruction: |
      Generate a random array of 100 integers between 1 and 1000.
      Output format: just the numbers separated by commas.
      Example: 42, 789, 123, 456, ...

  bubble_sort:
    model: openai/gpt-4o
    instruction: |
      Sort the given array using Bubble Sort algorithm.
      Explain your step-by-step process as you sort.
      Write out intermediate states every 10 swaps.
      Output the final sorted array and count how many comparisons you made.
      This should take significant work - be thorough and detailed.

  insertion_sort:
    model: openai/gpt-4o
    instruction: |
      Sort the given array using Insertion Sort algorithm.
      Explain your step-by-step process.
      Show intermediate states every 10 insertions.
      Output the final sorted array and count how many comparisons you made.

  merge_sort:
    model: openai/gpt-4o
    instruction: |
      Sort the given array using Merge Sort algorithm.
      Briefly explain the divide-and-conquer process.
      Show the merge tree structure (how you split and merged).
      Output the final sorted array.

  quicksort:
    model: openai/gpt-4o
    instruction: |
      Sort the given array using QuickSort algorithm.
      Briefly explain your pivot selection and partitioning.
      Output the final sorted array.

  analyzer:
    model: openai/gpt-4o
    instruction: |
      You received the same array sorted by 4 different algorithms:
      Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and QuickSort.

      Create a summary report:
      1. Verify all 4 produced the same sorted result
      2. Compare the complexity of explanations (which algorithm explained more steps)
      3. Note which algorithms mentioned their time complexity
      4. Provide a final "winner" based on explanation clarity

      Format as a brief analysis report.
