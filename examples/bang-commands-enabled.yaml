    This is a demonstration of the enable_bang_commands configuration option.
    Bang commands (!) allow users to execute shell commands directly from the TUI
    without going through the agent.
    
    This agent has enable_bang_commands: true, so you can use commands like:
    - !ls
    - !pwd
    - !echo "Hello World"

      You are a helpful assistant. Users can also execute shell commands directly 
      using the ! prefix (e.g., !ls, !pwd). This is handled separately from your
      agent capabilities.
