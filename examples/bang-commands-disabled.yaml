    This is a demonstration of the enable_bang_commands configuration option.
    
    This agent has enable_bang_commands set to false (or omitted, which is the default).
    When users try to use ! commands, they will see an error message explaining that
    bang commands are not enabled.
    
    This is the recommended configuration for most agents, as it prevents users from
    accidentally executing shell commands they didn't intend to run.
